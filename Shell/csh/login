# The .login script is executed for login shells.
# Note that when opening a new xterm or a new tab in gnome terminal,
# the new shell is not a login shell by default! Hence this script
# is not executed - instead, check for the $prompt variable in .cshrc
# to distinguish between interactive and non interactive shells!
