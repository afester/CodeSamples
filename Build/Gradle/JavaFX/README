This example shows how to build a minimal JavaFX 11 application using Gradle
(Remember that starting with Java 11, JavaFX is not bundled with the JDK anymore).

Note:
In Ubuntu 21.04, the default gradle version is 4.4.2 which is too old for the JavaFX plugin.
The Snap version is 7.0.2 which works well for the build, but then running the application fails
due to a GLIBC issue - because gradle then uses the java environment from the Snap.
Manually installing gradle to /opt and then using gradle from that directory worked well.
