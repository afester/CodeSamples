CodeSamples
===========

Various code samples from all kind of areas (Mainly C, C++, Java, Python).
Note that not all samples might be complete, runnable applications, some of them only go through the compiler but are not intended as runnable applications (even though I try to achieve this as much as possible). The samples can be imported into Eclipse as "existing projects".
